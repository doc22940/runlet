# Contributing to Runlet

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to Runlet!

There are many ways in which you can contribute. This document provides an overview of how you can get involved.

## Asking Questions

Have a question? Rather than opening an issue, please ask away on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/runlet) using the tag `runlet`. Your well-worded question will serve as a resource to others searching for help.

## Providing Feedback

Have you identified a reproducible problem in Runlet? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it!

[GitHub issues](https://github.com/runletapp/runlet/issues) should be used for bugs and feature requests. Notice, we don't want to use Github Issues for general 'how-to' questions about Runlet. We will therefore redirect general 'how-to' questions to Stack Overflow.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/runletapp/runlet/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

Be sure to scan through the [most popular](https://github.com/runletapp/runlet/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) feature requests.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* üëç - upvote
* üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely we will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

* Version of Runlet  

* Your operating system  

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

* What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw

* Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring

We will ask for more information if we can't reproduce the issue right away.
